# bioGen-EMS-2.0

**bioGen-EMS 2.0** is an advanced, open-source Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) toolkit designed to enable researchers, developers, and enthusiasts to explore integrating EMS technology in various interactive applications. This project builds upon the foundation of the original bioGen-EMS toolkit, offering enhanced features, improved hardware compatibility, and refined control mechanisms for more precise and versatile muscle stimulation.
This repository gives information about everything you need to build a programmable four-channel Electrical Muscle Stimulator (EMS), which we call bioGen-EMS. This setup is easy and requires off-the-shelf components.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An EMS device compatible with the bioGen-EMS 2.0 toolkit.
- A microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) for interfacing between your computer and the EMS device.
- Python 3.x installed on your computer.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Integrated-Motor-Play/bioGen-EMS-2.0.git
   cd bioGen-EMS-2.0
   ```

2. **Install the Required Python Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Upload the Firmware to Your Microcontroller:**
   - Navigate to the `firmware/` directory and upload the provided code to your Arduino or compatible microcontroller using the Arduino IDE or a similar tool.

4. **Connect the EMS Device:**
   - Connect your EMS device to the microcontroller as per the instructions in the `hardware/` folder.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can start using the bioGen-EMS 2.0 toolkit by running the provided Python scripts. These scripts allow you to control the EMS device, adjust stimulation parameters, and experiment with different configurations.

### Example

To run a basic EMS stimulation script, use the following command:

```bash
python ems_control.py --mode basic --intensity 50
```

Refer to the `examples/` directory for more complex use cases and detailed documentation.

## Hardware Requirements
